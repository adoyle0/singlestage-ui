# Singlestage Macro

This macro create is part of the Singlestage project. A familiar UI library for
[Leptos](https://leptos.dev) made with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com),
and based on [Basecoat](https://basecoatui.com), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), and [Radix](https://radix-ui.com).

## Introduction

Singlestage takes the familiar styling of [Radix](https://radix-ui.com/) and
[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and brings it to [Leptos](https://leptos.dev). It takes a
modular approach, meaning every component is feature flagged so you can take as much or as little
as you need.

In creating Singlestage we required some internal tooling. And we think that
some of that tooling can be helpful to our users, and the general (coding) public.

## Features

- Backwards compatible with previous public macros
- Focused on minimalism, modularity, and performance
- Feature flagged components

## Install

Singlestage macros are part of Singlestage, and therefore are available once
